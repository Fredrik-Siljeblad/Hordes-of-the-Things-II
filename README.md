## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals
        
        1. As a First time visitor, I want to quickly get an idea about the content of the site.
        2. As a First time visitor, I want the navigation between the different parts of the site to be easy and self-explanatory. I.E. - a link named "Gallery" should lead to some kind of gallery.
        3. As a First time visitor I want to be able to quickly navigate through the content on the site to see what content might be for me.
       

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        1. As a Returning visitor, I want to easily find links to more in-depth discussions of the ruleset.
        2. As a Returning visitor, I want to easily find links to Horde of the Things communities.
       
    -   #### Frequent User Goals
        1. As a Frequent user, I want to see if there is any new content.
        2. As a Frequent user, I want to easily navigate to links to communities.
       
-   ### Design
    -   #### Color Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are Black and Purple, to resonate with the color scheme of the rulebook.
    -   #### Typography
        -   As main font I have chosen Noto Sans, with Sans Serif as a fallback font family. Noto Sans is clean and easy to read. Quotations will be in Pattaya, a more playful font that gives the impression of handwriting.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Miniature wargaming is in large part about the visual aspect. The Hero image is chosen to give the impression of joining a gaming table.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First time visitor, I want to quickly get an idea about the sites content.

        1. The main focus on the index page is the Hero image that immediately conveys the idea of a miniature wargame.
        2. Clearly visible in the upper left corner is the Hordes of the Things heading, showing what game the site covers.
        3. To improve the visibility of the images (miniatures, after all are small) on smaller devices, we cut down the number of columns in the gallery section as the screen size becomes smaller.
     

    2. As a First time visitor, I want the navigation between the different parts of the site to be easy and self-explanatory. I.E. - a link named "Gallery" should lead to the gallery.

        1. At the top of the Hero image is the navigation bar, with the Home, About, Gallery, Community and Contact links.
       

     3. As a First time visitor I want to be able to quickly navigate through the content on the site to see what content might be for me.
        1. The navigation bar is the same on each page, making it easy to move from page to page, without having to move back or forth.
        2. The navigation bar is always on top of the reader, so the user does not have to scroll to get back to it.
        

-   #### Returning Visitor Goals

     1. As a Returning visitor, I want to easily find links to more in-depth discussions of the ruleset.
       
        1. These are easily reachable via the 'Community' tab.
     

    2. As a Returning visitor, I want to easily find links to Horde of the Things communities.

        1. These are easily reachable via the 'Community' tab.


  
-   #### Frequent User Goals

    1. As a Frequent user, I want to see if there is any new content.
      
        1. Not sure how to solve this best.

     2. As a Frequent user, I want to easily navigate to links to communities.

        1. The 'Communities' tab is easily reachable in the navigation bar.

5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site [link](https://github.com) in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
